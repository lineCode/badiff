/**
 * {@link Graph} which computes diff path lengths based not on the literal edge count between the origin
 * and a node but instead on the logical byte cost to serialize that edge sequence.  The general premise
 * is that the incremental cost of continuing an {@link Op}'s run is often less than the cost of starting
 * a new {@link Op}.<p>
 * 
 * The result of using a weight based on serialization rather than literal edge length is that, while
 * the sum of the runs of the path may be greater than with {@link EditGraph}, the serialized diff
 * will be smaller.<p>
 * 
 * For example, the difference between "Hello world!" and "Hellish cruel world!" is computed by
 * the {@link InertialGraph} as {@code >4-1+9>7;} and computed by {@link EditGraph} as
 * {@code >2+1>1+8>1-1>7;}.  The {@link InertialGraph} uses a total run length of 21
 * compared with {@link EditGraph}'s run length of 21, but the serialized length of the {@link InertialGraph}'s
 * diff is {@code 16}, versus {@code 21} for the {@link EditGraph}. <p>
 * 
 * The disadvantage of the {@link InertialGraph} compared with the {@link EditGraph} is that
 * it uses more memory to compute, and is slightly slower.  On the other hand, you get better diffs.
